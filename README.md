🌐 Simple Node.js Web Server
This project is a minimal, yet fully functional, web server built using Node.js and its built-in http and fs modules. It demonstrates core web development concepts, including modular routing, asynchronous file serving, and proper HTTP error handling.🚀 Project OverviewThe server is designed to handle multiple defined routes (/, /home, /about, /contact), serve static HTML content, and include styling from an external CSS file. It is configured to run on port 3000.🏗️ ArchitectureThe server follows a classic request-response model, utilizing Node.js's non-blocking I/O for efficient file serving.Request-Response FlowServer Initialization: The server starts, creates an instance using http.createServer(), and begins listening on port 3000.Request Handling: Upon receiving a request, the server extracts the req.url.Routing System: A switch-based routing system matches the URL path to the corresponding HTML file in the pages/ directory.File Serving Process: Asynchronous file reading (fs.promises) ensures non-blocking I/O for loading HTML and CSS content.Response Generation: Appropriate HTTP status codes (200 OK or 404 Not Found) and content-type headers (text/html or text/css) are set before sending the content back to the client.📁 Project StructureThe project is structured to maintain separation of concerns:my-web-server/

Once the server is running, you can access the routes via a web browser:ActionURLHome:http://localhost:3000/home (or http://localhost:3000/)About:http://localhost:3000/aboutContact:http://localhost:3000/contact404 Test:http://localhost:3000/invalid-route📝 Technical DetailsDetailValuePort3000ProtocolHTTPStylingExternal CSS (style.css)File SystemAsynchronous operations (fs.promises)Error HandlingComprehensive try-catch blocks🧪 Testing the ServerValid Routes Test: Access /home, /about, /contact—should return a 200 OK status and display the styled HTML content.Invalid Route Test: Access any undefined route—should return a 404 Not Found status and display the custom 404 page.Static Files Test: Verify that the CSS styling is applied correctly to all pages.Root Route Test: Access /—should correctly serve the home page content.
